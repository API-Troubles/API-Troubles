I'm a teen trying to learn programming and get a job in the field! Proud and active member of Hack Club! I love coding during my spare time, ~~and bashing my head against my keyboard because of errors haha.~~ Well, I seem to be short on my readme quota, oh well I'll add more here soon!

## Goals:
- Survive when robots take over Earth
- Get a job (Google?!?)
- Don't disappoint my parents
- Pass high school pls

## Find Me!
- I'm on Hack Club's slack, my username is @Felix Gao!
- Something will be added to my website eventually, [felixgao.dev](https://felixgao.dev).

Why isn't there a learned section? You never stop learning, tech always changes and you need to adapt with it :) (This is an excuse for my bad coding skills /j).
