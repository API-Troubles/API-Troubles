## My name is Felix!

I'm a teen trying to learn programming and get a job in the field! A proud and active member of Hack Club! I love coding during my spare time, ~~and bashing my head against my keyboard because of errors haha.~~ I build cool sites (at least to me) and Slack/Discord bots. I enjoy learning new libraries and trying new languages out! 

I've attended Counterspell Ottawa, a 24-hour hackathon game-jam at Shopify HQ. That place is awesome (if anyone at Shopify is somehow reading this, hiii!) and 11/10 would recommend working there (and I mean it! The vibes are amazing, open-floor, no offices and the couches are quite nice). That was an amazing experience and I encourage everyone to go to one!

## Goals:
- Survive when robots take over Earth
- Get a job (Google?!?)
- Don't disappoint my parents
- Pass high school pls

## Find Me!
- I'm on Hack Club's Slack, my username is @Felix Gao!
- Something will be added to my website eventually, [felixgao.dev](https://felixgao.dev).

Why isn't there a learned section? You never stop learning, tech always changes and you need to adapt with it :) (This is an excuse for my bad coding skills /j).
